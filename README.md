# Natual Languge Processing based Java Project AutoBuilder

# Introduction
This project is part of research work Mining Readme Files to Support Automatic Building of Java Projects in Software Repositories. We propose the first technique to automatically extract software build commands from software readme files and Wiki pages, and combine the extracted commands for software building. Specifically, we leverage the Named Entity Recognition(NER) technique for build-command extraction, and prioritize the extracted build commands to identify which one should be used in software build.
